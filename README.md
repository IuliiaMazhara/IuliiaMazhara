My automation team 

My previous client was a fintech corporation very keen on automation.
We had a developers team in the Philippines and a testing team in Ukraine and the Philippines. At first, I  was a key functional software testing engineer on the project.
However, the decision to expand the automation testing team was made. Rightfully, since we had only one automation testing engineer who left the company in November.
Before leaving, Alexandra shared with Ilya and me all she knew about automation on our project. And we proceeded with automating regression test cases that were previously developed and executed, well, by us. We were doing some in-sprint testing automation as well.
We cooperated very closely with frontend developers (locators and such) and backend developers (all issues with Java).
On the first of January, I officially became an automation tester. My automation career ended in 1 month and 24 days. I run away from russians to France and switched back to manual testing of the new features. Ilya and I were running automated test cases each sprint and managing old test cases., very few new tests were automated. Before leaving the project, I set up integration between our framework and TestRail. We also proceeded with setting up CI/CD with the help of dev ops from another stream.
To sum up, the goal of the project was to establish a solid team of full-stack testers. The team is to be responsible for in-sprint and regression testing, both manual and auto.
